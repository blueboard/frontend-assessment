# Frontend Project

## Description

The project is to create a page that displays "Rewards". The page will have tabs for all rewards and a separate tab for each different status type.

	Eg. If there are "new", "old", and "used" as statuses, then there will be tabs: All, New, Old, and Used

## Requirements

- Tabbed display with separate urls for each tab
- Ability to go to an edit page for each object (and persist edits locally)
- Add ability to sort, filter or search (Choose the fields you think are important)
- Do not use generators
- Write the logic which can migrate to web server instead of data.js easily

For technology, feel free to use any HTML/CSS framework you would like. On the Javascript end, stick with React/Redux stack (additional libraries allowed where you think it makes sense).

## Data

Thanks for taking the time to do this assessment project! In the `data.js` file, you will find a Javascript array that will serve as your data source.

## Deliverables

Please send a link to github repository of all your code to the assessor.
